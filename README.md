# javascript_dice_game
The game is a version of pig game developed using Javascript DOM functions.
The game is played between two players where each and every player gets a chance to roll the dice.
In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as he wishes. The score of the dice gets added up to the round score.
But, if the player rolls 1 his round score will be 0 and the next player gets a turn.
The player can choose to hold his round score which will be added to his global score by pressing the hold button. Once the player decides to hold the score the chance will be transfered to another player.
If the player rolls down the consecutive sixes then the round as well as the global score of the player will be 0. The chance will be transfered to the another player.
The first player to reach 100 in the global score will win the game.
